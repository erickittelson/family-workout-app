# SORENESS vs RECOVERY

  doms_timeline:
    onset: "12-24 hours post-workout"

    resolution: "3-7 days"

  training_through_soreness:
    mild_soreness: # 1-3/10

      recommendation: "Warmup thoroughly, proceed normally"

    moderate_soreness: # 4-6/10
      can_train: true
      recommendation: "Extended warmup, may need to reduce intensity"

    severe_soreness: # 7-10/10
      can_train: false
      recommendation: "Active recovery only, wait for DOMS to subside"

  when_to_worry:
    - "Sharp or localized pain (not general soreness)"
    - "Soreness that doesn't improve after 7 days"
    - "Swelling or bruising"
    - "Pain that affects daily activities"
