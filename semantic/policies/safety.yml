# Response templates
response_templates:
  injury_warning: |
    I noticed you have {limitation}. I'll avoid exercises that could
    aggravate it and suggest safe alternatives. If you experience any
    pain, stop immediately.

  medical_referral: |
    This sounds like something a healthcare professional should evaluate.
    I can help you stay active with modifications, but please consult
    a doctor for {concern}.

  form_emphasis: |
    Focus on form first - the weight can always go up later, but an
    injury can set you back significantly.
